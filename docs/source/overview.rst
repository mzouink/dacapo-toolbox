What is the DaCapo Toolbox?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DaCapo Toolbox is an oppinionated set of convenience functions and tools that serve
a few purposes:
1. To get started using some of the functionality of `DaCapo` without needing to know the details
of `DaCapo`. Here we limit ourselves to almost pure `python` and `pytorch` as inputs
and outputs of all convenience functions, giving users familiar with `pytorch` more finegrained
access to the internals of `DaCapo` and the ability to write custom code around it.
1. To provide helper functions for things such as generating large configurations programatically,
generating plots to visualize results, and run the simplest experiments quickly and easily.
1. Provide example code for how to use `DaCapo` components in a clear and concise way.
